# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to look into the provided standardized testing data for the City School district to identify performance trends and patterns in order to create informed decisions concerning funding and the overall performance of the district.  We have been tasked with removing data that may have been tampered with, and re-running the analysis to see how the removed grades have affected the results.

## Results

How is the district summary affected?

As we can see, the number of students has gone down, and the math scores have gone down as well.  This has affected the overall passing percentage by a tenth of a percent.

Again, we can see the passing percentage have decreased slightly after removing the grade 9 students from Thomas High School.

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Relative to the other schools, it has not had that much of an affect, and Thomas High School still has an overall passing percentage of almost 91%
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
The results dropped by up to four one hundredths of a percent
Scores by school spending
In the $630-644 range average math scores were barely affected
Scores by school size
The Math and overall scores for the medium school size bucket decreased slightly
Scores by school type
Very little noticible change.
## Summary
Overall, the overall numbers were not affected by more than several tenth of a percenatge point.
