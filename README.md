# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to look into the provided standardized testing data for the City School district to identify performance trends and patterns in order to create informed decisions concerning funding and the overall performance of the district.  We have been tasked with removing data that may have been tampered with, and re-running the analysis to see how the removed grades have affected the results.
